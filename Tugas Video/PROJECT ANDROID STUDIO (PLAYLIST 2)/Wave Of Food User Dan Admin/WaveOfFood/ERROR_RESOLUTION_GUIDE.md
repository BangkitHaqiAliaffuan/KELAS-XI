# üîß Wave Of Food - Error Resolution Guide

## Current Status

‚úÖ **What's Fixed**: 
- Removed Compose references that were causing import errors
- Set `useEnhancedCompose = false` as temporary fallback
- Your app should now compile and run with the original UI

‚ùå **Current Errors**: 
- Standard library and import resolution issues
- These are normal during Gradle sync process

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Sync Project (CRITICAL)
**This is the most important step - it will resolve 90% of the errors:**

1. **Look for the sync banner** at the top of Android Studio
2. **Click "Sync Now"** or go to `File ‚Üí Sync Project with Gradle Files`
3. **Wait for sync to complete** (may take 2-5 minutes)
4. **Check Build output** - should show "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"

### Step 2: Clean and Rebuild
After sync completes:

1. `Build ‚Üí Clean Project`
2. `Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project`

### Step 3: Test Original UI
Your app should now run with the original interface. Test that everything works.

### Step 4: Enable Enhanced Compose UI
Once the project syncs successfully, you can enable the new Material 3 UI:

1. **Uncomment the import** in MainActivity.kt:
```kotlin
import com.kelasxi.waveoffood.fragment.HomeFragmentWithCompose  // Uncomment this
```

2. **Update the fragment references** in MainActivity.kt:
```kotlin
// Change this:
HomeFragmentEnhanced()  // Fallback to original for now

// To this:
HomeFragmentWithCompose()  // New Material 3 UI
```

3. **Set the flag to true**:
```kotlin
private val useEnhancedCompose = true  // Enable new UI
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If "Sync Now" doesn't appear:
- Go to `File ‚Üí Sync Project with Gradle Files`
- Or click the Gradle elephant icon in the toolbar

### If sync fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try `File ‚Üí Invalidate Caches and Restart`
3. Close Android Studio, delete `.gradle` folder in project root, reopen

### If you still get "Unresolved reference" errors:
1. Ensure project sync completed successfully
2. Check `build.gradle.kts` was modified correctly
3. Try `Build ‚Üí Clean Project` then `Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project`

## üì± Expected Results

### After Sync (Original UI):
- App compiles and runs normally
- All existing features work
- No more red error indicators

### After Enabling Compose (Enhanced UI):
- Modern Material 3 design
- Beautiful food cards with ratings
- Smooth animations and interactions
- Professional appearance
